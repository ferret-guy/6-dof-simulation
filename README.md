# Py 6-dof Simulation

A rigid body 6-dof simulation built in python with numpy
 
This 6-dof simulation is intended for trade studies with flying things, the primary cordante system used is, 
ECEF (earth centered earth fixed)

It is intended that the tests will have 100% code coverage, with meaningful tests. 
A goal is for the tests that deal with major code sections to incorporate 
fuzzing tests over the entire input range (i.e. statistical testing)
